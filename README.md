This repository is associated with the publication [Instability of high polygenic risk classification and mitigation by integrative scoring](www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56945-0) (Citation: Misra, A., Truong, B., Urbut, S.M. et al. Instability of high polygenic risk classification and mitigation by integrative scoring. Nat Commun 16, 1584 (2025). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-56945-0)

Given a chronologically ordered list of tab-separated pairs of PGS Catalog Score ID and associated PGS Catalog Publication ID (along with a few other inputs, like a phenotype file and genotype data, which I'll enumerate later...), this pipeline will create chronologically iterative integrated polygenic risk scores for the trait in question using the PRSmix package and framework, in order to retroactively model the framework proposed and detailed in the aforementioned publication.

For any questions/concerns/bug-reporting/etc., contact misraani@broadinstitute.org (cc ani.misra26@gmail.com). Thanks!
